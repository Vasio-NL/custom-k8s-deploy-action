### Updating the action
After pushing new changes, make sure to tag new versions so they can be used in our deployments. We use semantic versioning.

To tag the version (v1.0.3 in the example):

`git tag v1.0.3`

also update the major version tag (v1 in the example):

`git tag v1 -f`

When finished tagging, make sure to push the tags:

`git push --tags -f`
